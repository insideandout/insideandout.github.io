		<h1>Morse code history</h2>
		<p> Samuel Morse was an inventor and painter. He was born in 1791, in the United States. After his wife's sudden death that he did not hear about for days, he decided to experiment
			and create a device that'd be effective for long-distance communication, and travel faster than letters. In 1844, Samuel Morse invented the telegraph, which took him 12 years to do 
			so. It was the first device that used electricity to send messages. It was first first used for radio transmission, then to send messages.</p>
